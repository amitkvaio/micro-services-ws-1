# **Eureka Service Discovery (Spring Cloud Netflix)**

---

## **1. The Problem (Before Eureka)**

* In earlier examples, we used **Feign** with hardcoded URLs.

  ```java
  @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange", url="localhost:8000")
  ```
* If we had multiple instances (8000, 8001, 8002â€¦), we had to **change the code/config** each time.
* If one server went down or a new one came up, we had to **update URLs manually**.
* This is **not practical** in a microservices architecture with many services.

---

## **2. The Solution â€“ Eureka Naming Server**

* Eureka acts as a **Service Registry**.
* All microservices **register themselves** with Eureka.
* Services ask Eureka for the **address of other services**, instead of using hardcoded URLs.

âœ… **No Hardcoded URLs** â†’ Just use **Service Name**

## **3. Dependencies**

### **For Eureka Server**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### **For Eureka Client**

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

---

## **4. Configuration**

### **Eureka Server (application.properties)**

```properties
server.port=8761
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
```

> `false` â†’ Because the server doesnâ€™t need to register itself.

---

### **Eureka Client (application.properties)**

```properties
server.port=8081
spring.application.name=user-service
eureka.client.service-url.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka
```

* Registers **user-service** with Eureka Server at port `8761`.

---

## **5. Flow of Service Discovery**

1. **Eureka Server Starts** â†’ Runs on port `8761`.
2. **Services Register** â†’ e.g.,

   * `user-service` â†’ Port 8081
   * `order-service` â†’ Port 8082
3. **Heartbeat** â†’ Services send "I am alive" signals every 30 sec.
4. **Service Lookup** â†’

   * `order-service` calls `http://USER-SERVICE`
   * Eureka resolves it to `http://localhost:8081`.
5. **Dynamic Updates** â†’

   * If new instances are added, they auto-register.
   * If a service dies, Eureka removes it.

---

## **6. Advantages of Eureka**

1. **Dynamic Service Discovery**

   * No hardcoded IPs/ports.
2. **Load Balancing Support**

   * Works with Ribbon/Feign.
3. **Health Checks**

   * Dead instances removed automatically.
4. **Scalability**

   * New instances register automatically.
5. **Resilience**

   * Uses cached data if Eureka is temporarily down.

---

## **7. Example with Currency Services**

* **Currency Exchange Service** registers as `CURRENCY-EXCHANGE`.
* **Currency Conversion Service** calls using:

  ```java
  @FeignClient(name="currency-exchange")
  ```
* Eureka resolves the name â†’ finds actual instance (`8000`, `8001`, etc.) â†’ Feign + Ribbon do load balancing.

---

ðŸ‘‰ **In Short:**

* Before: `@FeignClient(url="localhost:8000")` (Hardcoded)
* After Eureka: `@FeignClient(name="currency-exchange")` (Dynamic, scalable, load balanced)
